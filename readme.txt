Creates a post type for testimonials and allows you to display your testimonials in a beautiful, responsive slider with the help of a shortcode.

== Description ==
Managing testimonials can be a real pain. This plugin aims to make the process of testimonial creation and presentation easy for WordPress users. It comes with a beautiful slider that has been designed to integrate into any theme seamlessly. Just create a few testimonials (set your client's image as the featured image) and drop the shortcode `[wpsts_testimonial_slider]` in any page or post to display the responsive carousel.

You can also display a subset of the testimonials by using the category filter in the following manner:

`[wpsts_testimonial_slider category="some-category-slug"]`

Similarly you can limit the number of testimonials:

`[wpsts_testimonial_slider count="5"]`

Here are some other advantages of using this plugin:

**Customization options:** It is highly customizable. You can change the size and color of items without any difficulty. Similarly, all aspects of the slider including animation speed, number of items and autoplay can be controlled from the options panel.

**Public or private post type:** You can make the testimonial post type public or private any time you want. All you have to do is click on a button in the control panel. The same goes for the custom taxonomy.

**Completely responsive:** It should work on all screen sizes.
